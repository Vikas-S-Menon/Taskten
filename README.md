Create a simple html page named index.html with title 'Register'. 
The page must contain a form with fields: 
First Name 
Last Name
Email ID 
Phone Number 
Password 
Password (Confirm) 
and a Submit button.

On clicking the Submit button must load another html file named submit.html whch says 'You've been registered. Please check your email for details'.

Try running this setup using liveserver and check out your page in your web browser.

Make the UI prettier using basic CSS.

If you added all the CSS code in the html page itself, move it to a separate file named style.css.

Now using javascript in the html file itself I want to check if both passwords match.

Now like the css file, create a separate js file and move all the javascript into this new file.
